      <p>• To add source port, go to 'Options &gt; Add source port' and select one of the source ports available.
        <br>VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure that the source port you are choosing is added to your PATH variable.
        <br> If you do not know how to add a program to your PATH variable, see the link at the end of the instructions.
      </p>
      <p>• To manage your added IWADS and mods, simply use the options available in the 'Options' menu.
        <br>They are pretty self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>• To manage your profiles, use the 'Profiles' menu in your top bar.
        <br>The profiles you created are stored in your user home directory, in a folder named 'ccdoom'.
        <br>Each profile has it's own folder that contains text files with the information your provided.
      </p>
      <p>• If you encounter any issues, please go to 'Help &gt; Report issue' and write a detailed description of what is happening.
